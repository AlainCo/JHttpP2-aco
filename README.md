# JHttpP2-aco

old fork of jHttpP2

many improvements:
* support more methods like TRACE
* support multiple proxy, if the first don't work, use the next. keep memory of which proxy worked for a given website
* a variant can run as an Eclipse plugin
* scripts to start and configure

Basically it works well to nagigate daily.
